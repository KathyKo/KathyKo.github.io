> The app builder is a generative AI tool within PartyRock that can make different 
> apps for you through a process called inference. 
> * App Creation: PartyRock uses a generative AI tool to create applications based 
> on user descriptions, leveraging Amazon Bedrock's foundation models.
> * Widget Assembly: It generates instructions for app construction, detailing 
> necessary components and UI elements like text boxes and buttons.
> * Customization: In the app editor, users can customize by adjusting widget sizes
> positions, and functions to fulfill the intended app purpose.

#### What is a widget?
> Widgets in PartyRock are UI elements that can interact, display content, and 
> process input. They can be linked to create complex outputs, like text or images,
> using AI-driven prompts and data from other widgets. These AI-powered widgets 
> leverage foundation models for content generation.

#### Types of widgets
> * 3 AI-powered widgets: Image generation, Chatbot, and Text generation. 

> You can edit AI-powered widgets to connect them to other widgets and make their 
> output change.
> * 2 other widgets: User input and Static text.
