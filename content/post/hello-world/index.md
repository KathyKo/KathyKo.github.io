### Introduction

Google Cloud Document AI API and Google Cloud Vision API are both Google Cloud services designed for processing documents and images.


### 1.Document Processing:

> * Document AI API:  
> Document AI API focuses on processing structured documents, such as PDFs and OCR 
> documents. Its primary functionalities include text extraction, table recognition
> page identification, entity recognition (e.g., identifying dates and amounts in 
> contracts), and more. This makes it suitable for handling business documents like
> contracts, invoices, reports, and others.

> * Vision API:
> Vision API specializes in processing images and pictures. It can recognize 
> objects, faces, scenes, text, and more within images. Its main applications 
> include image classification, facial recognition, OCR text recognition, and more.
> This makes it suitable for image processing applications like image search, facial
> recognition, and automated image analysis.
 
### 2.Application Scenario:
> * Document AI API: 
> The Document AI API is suitable for business scenarios that involve processing a 
> large volume of structured documents, such as contracts, invoices, and medical 
> records.

> * Vision API: 
> The Vision API is well-suited for applications that require processing images and
> photos, such as image analysis and image search.
